# ExamPortal-SpringBoot

# Description

This project follows a client-server architecture, with Angular serving as the client-side framework and Spring Boot providing the backend API services. Spring Boot, a Java-based framework, offers a powerful and efficient way to build robust and scalable web applications. It provides a comprehensive set of features for handling HTTP requests, managing databases, and implementing security.

The backend of this project is built using Spring Boot, which includes the use of Spring MVC for request handling and routing, Spring Data JPA for database operations, and Spring Security for authentication and authorization. It leverages the Spring ecosystem's features and libraries to ensure a secure and efficient backend implementation.

The frontend, developed using Angular, seamlessly integrates with the Spring Boot backend through HTTP requests and APIs. Angular's component-based architecture, routing capabilities, and powerful data binding features enable the creation of a dynamic and responsive user interface. It utilizes Angular's reactive forms for handling user input and validation, ensuring a smooth user experience.

By combining the frontend capabilities of Angular and the backend functionality of Spring Boot, this project delivers a comprehensive solution for managing exams and student information in an educational setting. The Angular frontend provides an intuitive and engaging user interface, while the Spring Boot backend ensures robustness, security, and scalability. The synergy between these technologies creates a reliable and efficient application for educational institutions.
